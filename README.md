### Predicting Clinical Remission in IBD  

This repository contains my research on predicting clinical remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using advanced statistical modeling, including G-LASSO regression analysis. The project focuses on identifying key biomarkers and clinical parameters to enhance predictive accuracy and support personalized treatment strategies.

Key components include:

Data Processing & Feature Selection
G-LASSO Regression for Predictive Modeling
Model Validation & Replication of Previous Findings
This work contributes to precision medicine in gastroenterology by optimizing remission prediction for better patient outcomes.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the use of **Bayesian Networks** and **ensemble methods** for predicting clinical remission. The workflow includes **data cleaning, data preprocessing, handling missing values, up-sampling using SMOTENC, and Bayesian network modeling** based on both expert knowledge and structure learning. Finally, a **weighted ensemble voting classifier** is implemented to combine multiple models for improved prediction accuracy.
